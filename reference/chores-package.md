# chores: A Collection of Large Language Model Assistants

Provides a collection of ergonomic large language model assistants
designed to help you complete repetitive, hard-to-automate tasks
quickly. After selecting some code, press the keyboard shortcut you've
chosen to trigger the package app, select an assistant, and watch your
chore be carried out. While the package ships with a number of chore
helpers for R package development, users can create custom helpers just
by writing some instructions in a markdown file.
