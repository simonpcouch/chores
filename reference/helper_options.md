# Options used by the chores package

The chores package makes use of three notable user-facing options:

- `.chores_dir` is the directory where helper prompts live. See the
  helper
  [directory](https://simonpcouch.github.io/chores/reference/directory.md)
  help-page for more information.

- `.chores_chat` determines the underlying LLM powering each helper. See
  the "Choosing a model" section of
  [`vignette("chores", package = "chores")`](https://simonpcouch.github.io/chores/articles/chores.md)
  for more information.
